# PSOC&trade; Edge MCU: OTW(Over-the-Wire) Device Firmware Update

This code example demonstrates how to utilize Infineon's Device Firmware Update (DFU) middleware (MW) to update firmware over a serial interface (over-the-wire (OTW)), such as UART, SPI, I2C, or USB. 

The host (typically a PC) running the DFU Host Tool establishes a connection with the target device and downloads an application intended for the update. Images are downloaded to the staging region in non-volatile memory. Once downloaded successfully, the application resets the device to transfer the control to the bootloader. On reset, the bootloader validates the images in the staging region and installs it in the primary bootable region.

> **Note:** This CE only demonstrates I2C and USB interfaces for DFU. See other DFU code examples for SPI and UART interfaces.

This example also illustrates switching between I2C, USB-CDC, and USB-HID interfaces while the application is running without needing the device to be power cycled or programming recompiled binary. For example, on reset, this example selects I2C as the default interface for DFU. If you wish to change the interface to USB, simply press a user button (USER BTN1 - SW2) on PSOC&trade; Edge Evaluation kit.

This code example has a three project structure: CM33 secure, CM33 non-secure, and CM55 projects. All three projects are programmed to the external QSPI flash and executed in Execute in Place (XIP) mode. It also requires you to add the EdgeProtect bootloader project (*proj_bootloader*). It needs to be programmed on the device RRAM and is executed in Execute in Place (XIP) mode. The EdgeProtect bootloader is responsible for validation and update of the images downloaded to the device.

Extended boot launches the Edge Protect bootloader present in RRAM from a fixed location. The bootloader then configures the external QSPI flash in XIP mode, validates all the three applications, and launches the cm33 secure application (*proj_cm33_s*). The cm33 secure application launches the cm33 non-secure application (*proj_cm33_ns*), which is responsible for DFU operations. Additionally, CM33 non-secure application enables the CM55 CPU and launches the CM55 application.

See the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package installation guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxInstallguide) for information about installing and configuring the tools package.

Install a terminal emulator if you do not have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://teratermproject.github.io/index-en.html).

This example requires no additional software or tools.


## Operation

### Add the Edge Protect Bootloader

1. Add **proj_bootloader** to this code example as a first step. Follow the steps #2 to #7 in the **Operation** section of the [Edge Protect Bootloader](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-edge-protect-bootloader) code example's *README.md* file.

   > **Note:** [Edge Protect Bootloader](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-edge-protect-bootloader) *README.md* describes how to add the bootloader to **Basic Secure App**. Add it to **this** code example instead.

   > **Note (For the `LLVM_ARM` toolchain):**  **Edge Protect Bootloader** does not support `LLVM_ARM`. In the **proj_bootloader** directory, edit the *Makefile* to force other supported toolchains for EPB (for example: `TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM`)

### Configure the Memory Map and Makefiles

2. Configure the memory map: this code example bundles a custom *design.modus* file compatible with EdgeProtect Bootloader. Hence, you need not make any further customozations here to use EPB and this project together

3. Configure the *Makefile* with appropriate post-build instructions. Open *common.mk* file in the root of the application and update the `COMBINE_SIGN_JSON` variables for each `IMG_TYPE` with the JSON files generated by the configurator as:

    - **For `BOOT_IMAGE`:** Combine application projects and EdgeProtect bootloder project for initial programming and booting.
        ```
        COMBINE_SIGN_JSON?=./bsps/TARGET_$(TARGET)/config/GeneratedSource/boot_with_bldr.json
        ```
    - **For `UPDATE_IMAGE`:** Combine only the application projects for update
        ```
        COMBINE_SIGN_JSON?=./bsps/TARGET_$(TARGET)/config/GeneratedSource/boot_with_bldr_upgr.json
        ```

### Program the application

See [Using the code example](docs/using_the_code_example.md) for instructions on creating a project, opening it in various supported IDEs, and performing tasks, such as building, programming, and debugging the application within the respective IDEs.

4. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector

5. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud

6. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that "PSOC Edge MCU: DFU Code Example" and "Version 1.0.0" is displayed on the UART terminal

    **Figure 4. Terminal output on program startup**

    ![](images/boot.png)

7. Confirm the kit LED1 blinks at approximately 1 Hz. This means that the application is booted successfully

### Prepare for firmware update

8. Build the firmware update image to be transfered to the device to perform the firmware update:
    
    1. Change the `IMG_TYPE?=BOOT` variable to `IMG_TYPE?=UPDATE` in the *common.mk* in the the application root folder 
    2. Rebuild the complete project
    
    > **Note:** Do not program this image using KitProg3

9. Select the DFU transport interface on the device by pressing **USER BTN1** until your desired DFU transport interface is selected. See **Figure 5** and check out [Switching DFU Transport Interface](docs/design_and_implementation.md#switching-the-dfu-transport-interface) to understand how this works

    > **Note:** Skip this step if you want to use the default (I2C) DFU transport interface

    **Figure 5. Terminal output on DFU transport switch**

    ![](images/dfu_switch_output.png)
    
### Perform firmware update

10. Download the update image to the device and launch the EdgeProtect bootloader to perform the firmware update.

    1. *mdbdfu* file having the right command sequence to transfer the update image is provided here - **`<Workspace>/<CodeExampleName>`/Program.mtbdfu**. Open the file and update the `dataFile` field in "commands" section with absolute path of the project hex file **`<Workspace>/<CodeExampleName>`/build/app_combined.hex**
    
    2. Ensure instructions in [**Hardware Setup**](#hardware-setup) section are followed and connect the MiniProg4 USB to the host PC (for I2C DFU transport)

    3. Download the firmware using either the DFU Host Tool GUI or CLI

        <details><summary><b>Using DFU Host Tool GUI</b></summary>

        1. Open *dfuh-tool.exe* located at *\<install-path>/ModusToolbox/tools_3.6/dfuh-tool*
        2. Select *`<Workspace>/<CodeExampleName>`/Program.mtbdfu* as the input file to DFU Host Tool
        3. Select the interface for which you have set up the hardware
        4. Configure the selected interface as per the [DFU Transport Interface Configuration](docs/design_and_implementation.md#dfu-transport-interface-configuration)
        5. Click on *Execute* button; see **Figure 6** for reference

            **Figure 6. DFU Host Tool GUI**

            ![](images/gui.png)

        </details>

        <details><summary><b>Using DFU Host Tool CLI</b></summary>

        1. Open the modus-shell terminal and move to DFU Host Tool directory (*[install-path]/ModusToolbox/tools_3.6/dfuh-tool*)
        2. Execute the following DFU CLI command from the Host Tool directory in the shell terminal:

            ```
            dfuh-cli.exe --custom-command path-to-mtbdfu-file --hwid Probe-id/COM Port  --interface-params 
            ```

            For example, to use I2C interface, use:

            ```
            dfuh-cli.exe --custom-command `<Workspace>/<CodeExampleName>`/Program.mtbdfu --hwid MiniProg4-151D0D2303210400 --i2c-speed 400 --i2c-address 53
            ```

            **Figure 7. Console output of DFU Host Tool CLI**

            ![](images/cli.png)

        </details>

        > **Note:** See [DFU Host Tool for ModusToolbox&trade; User Guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxDFUHostTool) for more details on each of the interfaces
      
    4. After succesful download of the update image to the device, application triggers a system reset to launch the EdgeProtect bootloader for performing the update

        **Figure 8. Terminal output of image update**

        ![](images/update.png)

11. After firmware update is complete, confirm "PSOC Edge MCU: DFU Code Example" and "Version 2.0.0" are displayed on the UART terminal. Confirm that the kit LED2 blinks at approximately 0.5 Hz

    **Figure 9. Terminal output of updated image**
